## PRESENTATION
### Course guide
  
Welcome to the introductory course in data analysis with R!  


At the end of this course we can:  

  - Understand key concepts for data analysis and visualization.
  - Familiarize yourself with the R programming language.
  - Achieve transversal skills that will serve us for other programs such as Excel or Tableau.
  - Acquire skills in exploration, treatment and development of Big Data projects.  

 
We will find videos and articles to work on each of the points. We will combine theory with examples and activities that lead to reflection and implementation of the concepts learned.  


At the end of the last module we will find a test-type self-assessment test, in order to review and consolidate the contents. We can also download the course contents.
